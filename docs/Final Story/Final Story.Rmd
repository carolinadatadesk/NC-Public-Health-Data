## Overview

Overall description TK.

## Loading Data
This story was inspired by [reporting done by the Kaiser Health News service](https://github.com/khnews/2020-underfunded-under-threat-data/) and begins by using the data they collected and cleaned.

```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}
khn_state_public_health_agencies <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khnews/2020-underfunded-under-threat-data/master/data/01-state-public-health-agencies.csv")
```

## State Level Spending

### Changes From 2010-2018
**Spending on public health at the state level in North Carolina dropped by more than 27%. This is spending per capita, adjusted for inflation, between 2010 and 2018.**


```{r}
khn_state_public_health_agencies %>%
  filter(state_code =="NC", year %in% c(2010, 2018)) %>%
  select(year, expenditures_infl_per_capita) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "year", values_from = "expenditures_infl_per_capita", names_prefix="year") %>%
  mutate(pct_change = (year2018 - year2010) / year2010)
  
```

**Raw expenditures dropped about 6%.**
```{r}
khn_state_public_health_agencies %>%
  filter(state_code =="NC", year %in% c(2010, 2018)) %>%
  select(year, expenditures) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "year", values_from = "expenditures", names_prefix="year") %>%
  mutate(pct_change = (year2018 - year2010) / year2010)
  
```

**But when you adjust those raw numbers for the state's population increase during that time, the decline goes to 13%.**
```{r}
khn_state_public_health_agencies %>%
  filter(state_code =="NC", year %in% c(2010, 2018)) %>%
  select(year, expenditures_per_capita) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "year", values_from = "expenditures_per_capita", names_prefix="year") %>%
  mutate(pct_change = (year2018 - year2010) / year2010)
  
```


### Compared to Other States
**The national decline in state-level public health spending of 16%.**

```{r}
khn_state_public_health_agencies %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2010, 2018)) %>%
  #KHN excluded Missouri, Michigan, Texas and Wyoming 
  filter(!(state_code %in% c("MO","MI","TX","WY"))) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total_expenditures = sum(expenditures_infl), total_pop = sum(population)) %>%
  mutate(national_expenditures_infl_per_capita = total_expenditures / total_pop) %>%
  select(year, national_expenditures_infl_per_capita) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "year", values_from = "national_expenditures_infl_per_capita", names_prefix="year") %>%
  mutate(pct_change = (year2018 - year2010) / year2010) 
```

**North Carolina's per-person spending on state-level public health declined at a higher rate than all but six states -- Texas, South Carolina, Nevada, Kentucky, Arkansas and Alabama.**

```{r}
khn_state_public_health_agencies %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2010, 2018)) %>%
  select(state_code, year, expenditures_infl_per_capita) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "year", values_from = "expenditures_infl_per_capita", names_prefix="year") %>%
  mutate(pct_change = (year2018 - year2010) / year2010) %>%
  arrange(pct_change) %>%
  datatable()
  
```

**North Carolina state government spent about $72 per person on public health in 2018, which is less than all but 13 other states.**

```{r}
khn_state_public_health_agencies %>%
  filter(!(state_code %in% c("MO", "MI", "TX", "WY"))) %>%
    #KHN excluded Missouri, Michigan, Texas and Wyoming 
  filter(year == 2018) %>%
  select(state_code, expenditures_infl_per_capita) %>%
  arrange(expenditures_infl_per_capita)%>%
  datatable(options = list(pageLength = 15))
```

**Ten years ago, North Carolina spent just over $100 per person and ranked 12 places higher compared to other states.**

```{r}
khn_state_public_health_agencies %>%
  filter(!(state_code %in% c("MO", "MI", "TX", "WY"))) %>%
    #KHN excluded Missouri, Michigan, Texas and Wyoming 
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  select(state_code, expenditures_infl_per_capita) %>%
  arrange(expenditures_infl_per_capita)%>%
  datatable(options = list(pageLength = 50))
```



## Local Health Department Spending in N.C.
UNC students requested expenditures from all 85 local health department in North Carolina. They entered the data in a spreadsheet that matches the format of the Kaiser Health News expenditure data.  

The definition of expenditures on public health differ from year to year and from county to county. For example, some counties include veterans services in their public health budget while others do not. For this reporting, we used whatever definition each county used either in its budget or financial statements posted online or in their response to our request for public health expenditures.

Local expenditures on public health here include not just funding that comes directly from county governments. It also includes funding that comes from federal and state sources that are administered by local health departments. Including all these sources is standard practice nationally.

If there was any question about which spending to include or exclude, we used the [Financial Statement Template for Districts of Health](https://files.nc.gov/nctreasurer/documents/files/SLGFD/LGC/LocalGovFiscalMngmt/AnnualAud/FinancialStatementResources/IllustrativeFinancialStatements/other-financial-statement-templates-districts-of-health.xls) provided by the N.C. state Treasurer at [https://www.nctreasurer.com/state-and-local-government-finance-division/local-government-commission/other-units-financial-statement-resources](https://www.nctreasurer.com/state-and-local-government-finance-division/local-government-commission/other-units-financial-statement-resources) to guide us.

```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}
CompiledLHDExpenditures <- gsheet2tbl("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zc10pam92Y1218F90eXn9ri7-a4GQI1vhzING33nNSI/edit#gid=0") %>% 
  select(1:5)
```


They received data from 51 local health departments representing 56 counties, and there was some variance in the years each health department was able to provide.

```{r}
CompiledLHDExpenditures %>%
  group_by(lhd_name, county_name) %>%
  summarize(years_provided = n()) %>% 
  arrange(lhd_name) %>%
  datatable()
```


Forty-six health departments representing 51 counties provided full data spanning from 2010-2018.

```{r}
CompiledLHDExpenditures %>% filter(year >=2010, year<=2018) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = lhd_name, names_from = year, values_from = expenditures, names_prefix = "year") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(year2010),
         !is.na(year2011),
         !is.na(year2012),
         !is.na(year2013),
         !is.na(year2014),
         !is.na(year2015),
         !is.na(year2016),
         !is.na(year2017),
         !is.na(year2018)) %>%
  arrange(lhd_name) %>%
  datatable()

```


Population data for each county comes from the website of the State Demographer. We pulled only population from 2010-2018.

```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}
county_pop <- read_delim("https://demography.osbm.nc.gov/explore/dataset/population-voting-age-density-migration/download/?format=csv&disjunctive.area_name=true&disjunctive.area_type=true&disjunctive.year=true&disjunctive.data_type=true&disjunctive.vintage=true&refine.variable=Population+(Census%2FEstimate%2FProjection)&refine.year=2018&refine.year=2017&refine.year=2015&refine.year=2012&refine.year=2011&refine.year=2010&refine.year=2013&refine.year=2014&refine.year=2016&refine.area_type=County&timezone=America/New_York&lang=en&use_labels_for_header=true&csv_separator=%3B", 
    ";", escape_double = FALSE, col_types = cols_only(`Area Name` = col_character(), 
        Year = col_double(), Value = col_double()), 
    trim_ws = TRUE) %>%
  rename(county_name = `Area Name`, year = `Year`)


county_pop$county_name <-  str_sub(county_pop$county_name, end = -8)


county_pop<- county_pop %>%
  filter(county_name %in% c("Granville","Vance")) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(Value=sum(Value)) %>%
  mutate(county_name = "Granville & Vance") %>%
  select(county_name, year, Value) %>%
  union_all(county_pop)


county_pop<- county_pop %>%
  filter(county_name %in% c("Avery", "Mitchell", "Yancey")) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%

  mutate(county_name = "Martin, Tyrrell & Washington") %>%
  select(county_name, year, Value) %>%

  rename(population=Value)


CompiledLHDExpenditures<- left_join(CompiledLHDExpenditures, county_pop, c("county_name" = "county_name", "year" = "year")) 
  
```

*These health departments serve nearly 70% of North Carolinaâ€™s population.*

```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}
CompiledLHDExpenditures %>%
  filter(year==2018) %>%
  select(population) %>%
  summarize(pct_total_pop = sum(population) / 10389148) #2018 pop. from State Demographer
```


### LHD Per Capita Spending
```{r}
CompiledLHDExpenditures <- 
  CompiledLHDExpenditures %>%
  filter(!is.na(population), !is.na(expenditures)) %>%
  mutate(expenditures_per_capita = expenditures / population)

CompiledLHDExpenditures %>%
  select(year, lhd_name, county_name, expenditures_per_capita) %>%
  datatable()
```



### Inflation rates

In its reporting, Kaiser Health News inflation-adjusted all financial data to 2019 using the Bureau of Economic Analysis' "Government consumption expenditures and gross investment: State and local - implicit price deflator." 

Because this index itself is adjusted periodically, we simply reverse engineered inflation rates from the KHN data so that the data in our story could be used to make apples-to-apples comparisons with the original KHN data.




```{r}
infl_rates <- 
  khn_state_public_health_agencies %>%
  filter(!is.na(expenditures), !is.na(expenditures_infl),) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(total_raw = max(expenditures, na.rm=TRUE), total_infl = max(expenditures_infl, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(multiplier2019 = total_infl/ total_raw)

#Ugh. Have to hand-code two years
infl_rates <- infl_rates %>%
  add_row(year = 2012, multiplier2019 = 114.969 / 100) %>%
  add_row(year = 2013, multiplier2019 = 114.969 / 103.279)

infl_rates %>% 
  select(year, multiplier2019) %>%
  arrange(year)
```

Using the infl_rates data to create a new dataframe of all LHD expenditures, adjusted for inflation.
```{r}
CompiledLHDExpenditures <- 
  left_join(CompiledLHDExpenditures, infl_rates, by=c("year"="year")) %>%
  mutate(expenditures_infl = expenditures * multiplier2019, 
         expenditures_infl_per_capita = expenditures_infl / population) %>%
  select(year, lhd_name, lhd_area_type, county_name, population, expenditures, expenditures_infl, expenditures_per_capita, expenditures_infl_per_capita)

infl_nc_county_by_year <- CompiledLHDExpenditures %>%
  filter(year >=2010, year<=2018) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = county_name, names_from = year, values_from = expenditures_infl_per_capita, names_prefix = "year") %>%
  arrange(county_name)

infl_nc_county_by_year %>% datatable()
```

## Local Health Department Staffing in N.C.

Data comes via Kaiser Health News compilation of data in "[Local Health DepartmentStaffing and Services SummaryFiscal Year 2016â€“2017](https://schs.dph.ncdhhs.gov/schs/pdf/LHD_2017_FIN_20171120.pdf
), published by the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services's State Center for Health Statistics. This is the most recent year available for the report, which has been conducted since 1984. It is typically conducted every two years.



*From 2009-2017, 66 of the 85 local health departmentsâ€™ reported to the state DHHS that their full-time staff decreased. *
